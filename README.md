# Interactive-3D-Lorenz-Attractor-Visualization
An interactive computer vision application that renders a Lorenz Attractor, a system of differential equations. This application uses MediaPipe Hand Tracking to allow the user to physically manipulate the attractor. Users can rotate the attractor in 3D space, zoom in and out, and dynamically alter the parameters using hand gestures.
